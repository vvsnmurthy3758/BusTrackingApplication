ABSTRACT

The present generation requires the information time to time.The use of technogology 
have been increasing day by day.So we are planning for the combination of present 
technology with the requirement of information transmission, we planned for the 
creative approach of “Bus Tracking System”.
 
To overcome the drawbacks of the previous methods of paper based 
and we introduce a project to track a vehicle using GPS(Indian navic System). This Vehicle 
Tracking System can also be used for Tracking System and many more, by just making few changes in hardware and 
software and widely in tracking Cabs/Taxis, stolen vehicles, school/colleges buses 
etc

sensors

There are three main categories of sensors that smartphone having.
()Motion Sensors
()Environment Sensors
()Position Sensors

Let's see standard sensors that your smartphone is having.
1.Accelerometer
2.Ambient Light Sensor
3.Ambient Temperature Sensor
4.Air Humidity Sensor
5.Barometer Sensor
6.Finger Print Sensor
7.Gyroscope Sensor
8.Harmful Radiation Sensor
9.Magnetometer
10.NFC Sensor
11.Proximity Sensor
12.Pedometer Sensor
